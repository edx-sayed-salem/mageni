tag_insight = "Multiple vulnerabilities has been found and corrected in ntp:

Requesting peer information from a malicious remote time server
may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code
execution (CVE-2009-0159).

A buffer overflow flaw was discovered in the ntpd daemon's NTPv4
authentication code. If ntpd was configured to use public key
cryptography for NTP packet authentication, a remote attacker could
use this flaw to send a specially-crafted request packet that could
crash ntpd (CVE-2009-1252).

Packages for 2008.0 are being provided due to extended support for
Corporate products.

The updated packages have been patched to prevent this.

Affected: 2008.0";

of md5 checksums and GPG signatures is performed automatically for you.
