tag_insight = "The GNU tar program saves many files together in one archive and can
  restore individual files (or all of the files) from that archive.

  A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way tar expanded archive
  files. If a user were tricked into expanding a specially-crafted archive,
  it could cause the tar executable to crash or execute arbitrary code with
  the privileges of the user running tar. (CVE-2010-0624)
  
  Red Hat would like to thank Jakob Lell for responsibly reporting the
  CVE-2010-0624 issue.
  
  A denial of service flaw was found in the way tar expanded archive files.
  If a user expanded a specially-crafted archive, it could cause the tar
  executable to crash. (CVE-2007-4476)
  
  Users of tar are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which contains
  backported patches to correct these issues.";
